        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
        <dt> <b> <strong>What is a yurt?</strong></b></dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
            the ground. <br> Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
            a wooden floor, and a <br> roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
        <dt> <b> <strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></b></dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                quilt and <br> gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                experience includes electricity <br> and a sink with hot and
                cold running water. Shower and restroom <br> facilities are
                located in the lodge.</dd>
        <dt> <b> <strong>What should I bring?</strong></b></dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
            dress for <br> changing weather with light layers of clothing.
            It's also helpful to <br> bring a flashlight and a sense of
            adventure! <br></dd>
